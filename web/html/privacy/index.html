                <p class="mt-10">Last update: 10 May 2022</p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures regarding the collection and use of your
                    information when you use the service and informs you of your privacy rights and how the law protects
                    you.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    When we say "company", "we", "us", "our", "us", "service" or "services" in this document, we mean
                    WACHO.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not
                    hesitate to contact us.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    At WACHO, we are committed to complying with the GDPR, the CCPA and other privacy regulations on our
                    platform. The privacy of your data -and it's your data, not ours!- is an important issue for us.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    In this policy, we explain what data we collect and why, how your data is handled and your rights
                    over it. We promise you that we will never sell your data: we never did it and we never will.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-20">Quick summary</h2>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    We value your <b>privacy</b> very highly. That is why all the data we collect is completely
                    <b>anonymised</b>, as it <b>does not</b> require cookies and <b>is not</b> shared with third
                    parties.

                <p class="mt-10">
